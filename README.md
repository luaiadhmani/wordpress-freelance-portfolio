# 🌐 Freelance Services Website (WordPress)

This is my **first custom WordPress website**, built independently as a real-world freelance portfolio to showcase my web design and development services.

I created it using **Elementor**, the **Astra Theme**, and developed it locally with **LocalWP** — no full tutorial, just research, trial and error, and practical learning.  
This project marks the beginning of my freelance journey, with a focus on delivering quality work and constantly improving.

This site is structured clearly, styled professionally, and designed with real client projects in mind.

### 🔍 Key Pages:
- 🏠 **Home Page** – Hero intro, anchor links, and service highlights
- 👤 **About Page** – My story, skills, and values
- 💼 **Services Page** – A clean list of my offerings
