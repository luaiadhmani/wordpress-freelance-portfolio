## 📄 Project Description

This is my first real-world freelance website built from scratch without following a step-by-step tutorial. 
I began by studying and practicing with a Tech Startup Elementor template, then **rebuilt it into my own branded freelance services site** — structured clearly, styled consistently, and designed with real client work in mind.

### 🧩 The Website Includes:
- 🏠 **Home Page** – Hero intro, service highlights, and smooth anchor links
- 👤 **About Page** – My background, skills, and mission
- 💼 **Services Page** – Clear list of the services I offer
- ✉️ **Contact Page** – Simple contact form and navigation anchors
